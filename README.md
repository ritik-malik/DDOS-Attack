# DDOS-Attack
A simple attack on web-server
## ABOUT
This script is for attacking unprotected websites & servers. I myself have tested this script on ECell's server XD. It crashed in matter of 4 secs, (I used 8 PCs). What the main script does is that it sends get request to the host website using wget, download the data & simultaneously delete it, & this cycle is repeated for 10secs. There is another file that runs this file parallely 10000 times, making lakhs of request in total. Change the values accoring to your PC, otherwise it may freeze your PC.
